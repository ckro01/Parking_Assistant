# Parking_Assistant
First prototype of parking assistant currently completed. As I have more time I will continue to update both the physical design, and overall package. 
The overall goal of this project is to create a simple, yet effective wall-mounted sensor package that assists in parking vehicles in tight spaces.
Currently, the position of the ultrasonic sensor is suboptimal, as it has issues regarding the height of varying vehicles.
One solution to this would be to extend the sensor down to a level that works for all vehicles. 
In order to improve overall reliability, some sort of logic/algorithm should be applied to the data input of the ultrasonic sensor to more accrurately detect a vehicle.
Also need to fix the ugly LED array, maybe use a bar of LEDs, or something new altogether.
